# Solar-System-Formation
This p5.js program simulates how dust and particles might clump together and form rings and planets around a body in space. Basic gravity and collision effect all the particles which, over time, result in something akin to a solar system.

## How To Use It

* WASD - Pan camera around simulation.
* Mouse Click - Add particles to the simulation.
* N - Spawn particles randomly around the simulation.

*You can drag click to specify how much velocity you want the particle to have.*

## Getting Started

If you want to mess around with the code on your local machine, you can follow these steps to set up the development env.

### Prerequisites

This project uses the p5.js library, which is available [here](https://p5js.org). You could download and install the provided text editor in order to use it, or you could just download the libraries that come along with this project and edit it with a different text editor.

### Setting Up

* Create a folder called `Solar System Formation` or whatever you intend on naming the project.
* Within this folder, create another folder called `libraries`.
* Copy the files in this projects [libraries folder](libraries) into your libraries folder.
* Copy the other files in this project ([index.html](index.html) and [sketch.js](sketch.js)) into the root folder you created first.
* Now you should be able to run the index.html file in most browsers.

### Developing

There is no need to edit the index.html file or any of the libraries, as they are part of p5.js. The simulations code is all located in the sketch.js file. If you are unfamiliar with p5.js, [their website](https://p5js.org) contains a full list of references and examples.
